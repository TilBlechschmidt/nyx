This tutorial covers some of the basics of using nyx and its builtin features.
Nyx is highly configurable, and used at Advanced Space for much more than what's being shown here.
For example, it is relatively easy to create new dynamics which leverage those available in nyx with new equations of motion;
or the definition of new `MeasurementDevice`s which account for specific clock errors.

# Celestial computations
## Orbital state manipulation
As in any astrodynamics toolkit, it's essential to be able to convert a state from one definition to another (e.g. Cartesian state to Keplerian state).
